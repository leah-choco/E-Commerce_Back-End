# E-commerce Back End 
Demonstration:
[Module 13 Challenge.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109236891/199082190-1f957815-d8fa-4fc9-804c-b1ade5351996.webm)

## Goals of this Project:
GIVEN a functional Express.js API

WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file

THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

WHEN I enter schema and seed commands

THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data

WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application

THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags

THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core

THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Installation:
You will need to install "mysql2", "sequelize", "dotenv", and "express".

## What I Learned:
I began with a starter code and needed to modify it to satisfy the goals. The comments in the files indicate what code I personally wrote. 

As this project runs completely on the back end, it was all about testing the api routes that I wrote in Insomnia. The biggest takeaways were about Insomnia as a tool and its capabilites.
